prop drilling, context, redux all are used for same purpose i.e. data mgmt i.e. to get the data from one componrnt to all/other 

context is used to avoid PropDrilling.




Redux working

-> If we want to add an item to a cart then -> Once the + icon is clicked then it dispatches an action which calls a reducer function which updates the slice on the redux store.

where slice - logical separation on the store
store - the central place where the components or code that will be used by all the components will be stored.


-> If we want to read from cart - We use a Selector to read from cart and use it in our code when needed.

Selector is a hook. (useSelector)
